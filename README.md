Hello, In this mini project I did the web scraped 'Largest companies in India' from the real website and exporting into CSV file.
Initially I pulled out the information from WIKIPEDIA and inspect the html code.
I used BeautifulSoup package for this project.
In python code, I imported the packages and get the url by requests function
Using BeautifulSoup package and default function I got the inner html code that I'd inspected.
I'd imported the pandas package and create a dataframe to importing the existing inspected striped header text and individual data.
Then I changed the dataframe to CSV format "C:\Users\pavit\OneDrive\Documents\wsoutput\companies.csv"  ...
